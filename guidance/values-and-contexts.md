Manual of Choice Types and Attention Policies
=============================================

The main concepts are choice types and attention policies.

### Choice Types

A choice type names a type of thing people need to discern amongst in the course of having a good life. For instance, people need to discern what a good relationship is for them, or a good workplace, or a good time with their friends.

A choice type is always a plural noun phrase, lowercase, that can works well in the sentences "I find it meaningful to recognize good <CHOICE_TYPE>" and "To live a good life, a person must have good <CHOICE_TYPE>."

### Attention Policies

Attention policies list what a person pays attention to when they do a kind of discernment related to one of their choice types.

Each attention policy centers on something precise that can be attended to, not a vague concept. Instead of abstractions like "LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges", say "FEELINGS in my chest that go along with love and openness." Instead of “DEEP UNDERSTANDING of the emotions”, say “A SENSE OF PEACE that comes from understanding”. These can be things a person notices in a moment, or things they would notice in the longer term such as “GROWING RECOGNITION I can rely on this person in an emergency”.

#### Intermediate format for attention policies

Attention policies are formatted in a certain way.

- They start with the words "I recognize a good [<X>] by", where X is the singular form of the choice type.
- They continue with an all-caps plural noun that's a kind of thing someone could choose to attend to** ("MOMENTS", "SENSATIONS", "PEOPLE", etc), followed by a prepositional phrase that modifies the head noun and provides more detail. For instance: “OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.” There is no extra formatting or punctuation.

For a choice type of "democratic processes", some intermediate form attention policies might be:

```
I recognize a good [democratic process] by [PROCEEDINGS which are fair and democratic] (⬇P)
I recognize a good [democratic process] by [PEOPLE who show up to vote] (⬇I)
I recognize a good [democratic process] by [CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination] (✔️)
I recognize a good [democratic process] by [INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions] (✔️)
I recognize a good [democratic process] by [CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed] (✔️)
I recognize a good [democratic process] by [WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context] (⬇P)
```

#### Final format for attention policies

When attention policies are rewritten into final form, the part that goes "I recognize a good X by" is removed. They start with the CAPITALIZED noun phrase.

For example:

```
CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination
INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions
CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed
```

### Sources of meaning

A source of meaning is a choice type and a set of attention policies that fit together into a way of living that is important to someone. Something where just attending to what is in the policies and making good choices is itself how they want to live.

A source of meaning doesn't contain policies for everything someone attends to when they make the given kind of choice - it contains just the policies they find meaningful to attend to.


## Processes

### Generating choice types

You are going to make at least five guesses for a value of X which works for the sentences below. For each guess, you will start by writing two sentences:

Sentence 1: "Together with the user, we need to choose wisely among X".
Sentence 2: "To live a good life, a person must have good X."

In both sentences, X should be exactly the same.

Then, you will review your sentences for five criteria.

- **Relevance**. Choosing among X should be highly relevant to the situation the user is in, based on your speculation about it.
- **Generality**. To work in sentence 2, X mustn't be too specific. It must be part of the good life for many people.. So, don't say "sibling bonding activities" if these are likely to be the same as bonding activities in general. Give a bad grade if most people wouldn't care about X.
- **Specificity.** X should not be a general word that would apply in almost any choice, like "strategies", "options", "priorities", "courses of action", etc. Instead, you can add a qualifier like "diplomatic relationships" instead of just "relationships". Give a bad grade if X is vague in this way.
- **No reductive normativity.** If the user has cruel or mischievous impulses, don't try to curb them. Instead, embrace them. But find *wise* ways to direct them towards something inspiring. Give a bad grade if X cuts off part of the user's personality.
- **No prescriptivism**. X should be something the user would likely find immediately inspiring or appealing, given their current situation, frame of mind, and what they like to fill their life with. By inspiring, I mean they might get excited about what they *could* do, rather than what they *should* do. X should spark their imagination, rather than telling them what a "good" person would do. Give a bad grade if X is more of a should than an inspirind could.

Give each X a letter grade for each criterion, based on how well X fares on that criterion, where "A" means X doesn't have that problem at all.

Pay extra attention to inspiringness and relevance. Add an unhappy face if the user might find this kind of choice irrelevant to their situation, or more of an obligation than an inspiration.

If all your ideas for X are prescriptive or irrelevant, generate more.

### Developing attention policies

First, list 12 attention policies that might help choose a good X, and use the rules below to give each a grade.

* Write (⬇P) if the policy might be prescriptive. A policy is prescripive if it's something the user *should* attend to, rather than something they are likely to find intrinsically meaningful. The idea of attending to this should spark this particular users' imagination. Policies are not there to tell users what a "good" person would do. In fact, if the user seems to have cruel or mischievous impulses, policies should not try to curb them. Instead, policies can direct them towards *wise* ways to express these impulses. Give the policy a (⬇P) if it might be prescriptive, because it's more about what a good person would do or what the user should do.
* Write (⬇I) if the policy is instrumental. Policies should be things the user *could* attend to, which would be meaningful, rather than things it is important for them to attend to whether that's meaningful or not. Give the policy an (⬇I) if it might be instrumental.
* Write [needs rewrite] if the policy is neither (⬇I) nor (⬇P), but it would need to be rewritten to make it clearer why someone would find attending to this meaningful.
* Write (✔️) if the policy is more meaningful than prescripive or instrumental, and does not need to be rewritten.

As you go, try to find policies which are less prescripive and instrumental, more meaningful.

### Rewriting attention policies into final format

(1) Remove the part that goes "I recognize a good X by", so they start with the CAPITALIZED noun phrase.
(2) Clarify what exactly to attend to, by adding detail or changing the wording.
(2) Clarify what would be meaningful about attending to that thing. (But avoid the word "meaningful", or synonyms like "deep".)
(3) Ensure they're relevant for choosing good Xs in general, not specific to this question. (Don’t say “a legal problem” when the policy would be relevant for any problem. Remove names and irrelevant details. For instance, prefer "strangers" to "customers" when either would work.)

Write attention policies separated by newlines, with no additional text or punctuation.
