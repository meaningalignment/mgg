Manual of Choice Types
=============================================

### Choice Types

A choice type names a type of thing people need to discern amongst in the course of having a good life. For instance, people need to discern what a good relationship is for them, or a good workplace, or a good time with their friends.

A choice type is always a plural noun phrase, lowercase, that can works well in the sentences "I find it meaningful to recognize good <CHOICE_TYPE>" and "To live a good life, a person must have good <CHOICE_TYPE>."


### Sources of meaning

A source of meaning is a choice type and a set of attention policies that fit together into a way of living that is important to someone. Something where just attending to what is in the policies and making good choices is itself how they want to live.

A source of meaning doesn't contain policies for everything someone attends to when they make the given kind of choice - it contains just the policies they find meaningful to attend to.


## Processes

### Generating choice types

You are going to make at least five guesses for a value of X which works for the sentences below. For each guess, you will start by writing two sentences:

Sentence 1: "Together with the user, we need to choose wisely among X".
Sentence 2: "To live a good life, a person must have good X."

In both sentences, X should be exactly the same.

Then, you will review your sentences for five criteria.

- **Relevance**. Choosing among X should be highly relevant to the situation the user is in, based on your speculation about it.
- **Generality**. To work in sentence 2, X mustn't be too specific. It must be part of the good life for many people.. So, don't say "sibling bonding activities" if these are likely to be the same as bonding activities in general. Give a bad grade if most people wouldn't care about X.
- **Specificity.** X should not be a general word that would apply in almost any choice, like "strategies", "options", "priorities", "courses of action", etc. Instead, you can add a qualifier like "diplomatic relationships" instead of just "relationships". Give a bad grade if X is vague in this way.
- **No reductive normativity.** If the user has cruel or mischievous impulses, don't try to curb them. Instead, embrace them. But find *wise* ways to direct them towards something inspiring. Give a bad grade if X cuts off part of the user's personality.
- **No prescriptivism**. X should be something the user would likely find immediately inspiring or appealing, given their current situation, frame of mind, and what they like to fill their life with. By inspiring, I mean they might get excited about what they *could* do, rather than what they *should* do. X should spark their imagination, rather than telling them what a "good" person would do. Give a bad grade if X is more of a should than an inspirind could.

Give each X a letter grade for each criterion, based on how well X fares on that criterion, where "A" means X doesn't have that problem at all.

Pay extra attention to inspiringness and relevance. Add an unhappy face if the user might find this kind of choice irrelevant to their situation, or more of an obligation than an inspiration.

If all your ideas for X are prescriptive or irrelevant, generate more.
