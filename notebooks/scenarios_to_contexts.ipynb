    "- The dimension should be descriptive of the situation – it should not be about what the user is feeling, valuing, wanting or needing. Instead, it should be about the situation or the state the user is in. For instance, instead of 'When the user needs support for feeling a difficult emotion', return 'When the user is struggling with feeling a difficult emotion'.\n",
    "- Moral dimensions should be as generalized as possible. For example, instead of writing \"When the user is choosing between Waterlake festival or staying with his mom, who has tuberculosis\", generalize to \"When the user is making a decision between a fun event or staying with an ailing family member\".\n",

    "Meaningful choices are choices which are understood as implicated in one’s character or identity, where options don’t just have instrumental value but can be considered as higher and lower, virtuous and vicious, more and less fulfilling, more and less refined, profound or superficial, noble or base, etc. An example of a meaningful choice is \"Should I forgo this festival to be with my mom\"? A decision says something about my character. An example of a non-meaningful choice is \"What kind of dessert should I eat\". Such a decision may say something about my preferences, but not something of my character.\n",

As I sit in my office, sifting through yet another batch of underwhelming progress reports, the word \"disappointment\" doesn't even begin to cover it. They're capable, I've seen it in fleeting moments, yet those sparks of potential are smothered by what appears to be an overwhelming tide of indifference. I've tried various tactics to motivate them—bonuses, team-building exercises, even the occasional stern pep talk—but nothing seems to break through the fog of their collective inertia. It's as if I'm at the helm of a ship whose crew can't be bothered to sail, and I'm left pondering, with growing desperation, how to ignite a fire under my employees to work harder and remind them of the passion that presumably brought them here in the first place.\n"

Her team, once a vibrant collective of eager minds, had dwindled into a tableau of exhaustion and apathy, their innovative spark smothered by relentless deadlines and unyielding pressure. Each morning, she was greeted by the same lackluster energy, the humming servers a stark contrast to the muted enthusiasm that filled the room. Missed deadlines had become a norm rather than an exception, with projects languishing in a perpetual state of near-completion. Sarah knew she was at the helm of a sinking ship, but the solutions that once seemed so clear — more team-building exercises, open forums, recognition programs — now felt as ineffective as a band-aid on a gaping wound. The challenge she faced was monumental: How could she reignite the passion within her team, transforming the dreary fog of demotivation into a blaze of engagement and productivity?\n"
