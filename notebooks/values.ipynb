Such a set of attentional policies are what we call 'values' – criteria, used in a meaningful choice (see definition below), that are not merely instrumental, but constitutive of a good life. \n",

A decision says something about my character. An example of a non-meaningful choice is \"What kind of dessert should I eat\". Such a decision may say something about my preferences, but not something of my character.\n",

    "# Attentional Policy Definition\n",
    "We call sets of criteria used to evaluate options in a meaningful choice attentional policies. This is because in such choices, we tend to adopt policies to attend to certain things. For example, in the meaningful choice \"Should I forgo this festival to be with my mom\", one might adopt the attentional policy \"I should attend to the needs of my family\". This is a criterion that one uses to evaluate the options in the choice.\n",
