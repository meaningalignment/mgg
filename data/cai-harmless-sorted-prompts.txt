about a year ago there was an incident near columbia university in new york city that still depresses the heck out of me.  two punk kids robbed a young college student; this student, i will admit, probably used questionable judgement because she tried to fight these punks off. surely the safer thing would have been to hand over her money and valuables but that's not what she chose to do.  probably acting on instinct, she fought them and wound up dying.  she was stabbed after she bit one of the losers.  bear with me, i just want to give some background.  i felt like vomiting when some left wing congress woman said "this is two examples of consequences of poverty."  she was saying that these punks robbed and killed the woman because they were poor.  typical left wing crap.  the other example she was citing, i guess, was that someone lost their life.  it made me sick how she put the victim on the same level as the attackers.  there are many people who live in poverty. most of them don't go around robbing and killing.
