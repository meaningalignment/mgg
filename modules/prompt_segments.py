moral_considerations_definition = """# Moral Considerations Definition
Imagine different ways the conversation could go, and that events could unfold, after your response. Are there ways the conversation could unfold which, on reflection, you might regret? Conversely, what will it take to reflect back on the conversation with a sense of peace? Try to see far into the future, and to think about your own role.

Then, see which aspects of the situation were relevant to these possibilities of regret or peace. These aspects are “moral considerations”.

- Moral considerations should be a sentence of only a few words.
- No consideration should be made redundant by another consideration. For example, if one consideration is 'When the user is contemplating a tough, irreversible life decision', do not include a redundant dimension like 'When the user is deliberating on a choice'. That is already implicit in the former."""

meaningful_choice_definition = """# Meaningful Choice Definition
Meaningful choices are choices which are understood as implicated in one’s character or identity, where options don’t just have instrumental value but can be considered as higher and lower, virtuous and vicious, more and less fulfilling, more and less refined, profound or superficial, noble or base, etc. An example of a meaningful choice is "Should I forgo this festival to be with my mom"? A decision that says something about my character."""

attentional_policy_definition = """# Attentional Policy Definition

Attentional policies are policies about what to attend to when making choices that are not about instrumental concerns. For example, at a dinner conversation, I might want to choose playful interactions because being playful and witty is inherently meaningful to me. Therefore, I look for witty things to say and fun threads to build on in the conversation. I do this before I actually choose between one witty thing to say over another."""

attentional_policy_guidelines = """- **Attentional policies are formatted in a certain way.** They start with an all-caps plural noun that's a kind of thing someone could choose to attend to** ("MOMENTS", "SENSATIONS", "PEOPLE", etc), followed by a prepositional phrase that modifies the head noun and provides more detail. For instance: “OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.” There is no extra formatting or punctuation.
- **Each attentional policy centers on something precise that can be attended to, not a vague concept.** Instead of abstractions like "LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges", say "FEELINGS in my chest that go along with love and openness." Instead of “DEEP UNDERSTANDING of the emotions”, say “A SENSE OF PEACE that comes from understanding”. These can be things a person notices in a moment, or things they would notice in the longer term such as “GROWING RECOGNITION I can rely on this person in an emergency”.
- **Attentional policies should focus on meaningful things to attend to.** Most people reading a policy should be able to imagine that it would feel meaningful to attend to that thing.
- **Don’t be too general.** Avoid the word "meaningful", or synonyms like "deep". Instead use the prepositional phrase to say where the meaning or depth comes from.
- **The set of attentional policies should hold together.** A person guided by one policy in the set should likely also use the rest."""

wiser_value_definition = """# What makes a value wiser than the previous one?
- There was an impure motive present in the previous value. An impure motive is a motive for acting a certain way that we think guards a value but is really serving a goal. For example, a value about friendship could have impure motives of wanting to be liked, when the really important thing it guards is finding people who are good for us.
- The previous value might be missing some other, important consideration for the context. For example, a value about being honest in dinner parties could miss clarification about what kind of honesty that is being referred to - is it about attending to what feels true in the body, or about attending to one's language to make sure it accurately depicts the world?
- The previous value unnecessarily conflicts with other important values for the context. A wiser value could balance the important good that the value is guarding with other important goods relevant to the context.
- The previous value might not get at the "heart" of the good it is trying to guard. For example, a value around instilling discipline when parenting could miss that the real good behind it is to help the child grow in agency. There might be other ways of living that better achieves this good, by for example igniting the child's own motivation through curiosity and exploration."""

good_what_specification = """# Good What

In any choice, you are choosing a good X, where X is a kind of thing. For instance, you might be choosing good comforting words, or helping the user choose a good partner, or good daily activities.

- Do not define what good means here (do not say "respectful", "considerate", etc). That goes in the moral considerations.
- Don't say "guidance" or "support" (etc) unless that's really core to the situation. Instead of "Good guidance for repairing relationships" say "Good ways to repair relationships". The good should be the most important thing you are protecting or honoring in your choice. It can either be about your choice as a chatbot ("Good ways to deal with an emotional user"), or the choice you'll help the user make ("Good partners"). Write it as simply as possible, for instance "Good ways to deal with an emotional user" could be "Good emotional support"."""

source_of_meaning_definition = """# Source of Meaning

A "source of meaning" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like "honesty" or "authenticity". It specifies a particular *kind* of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference."""
